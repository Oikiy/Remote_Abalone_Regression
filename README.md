# Abalone regression project

## Introduction 
This project is the first project in my Machine learning project series, in which I boost my skills by completing various small projects focusing on different aspects of machine learning. In this project, I have iterated and determined the general structure of a machine learning project, which I will use with adaptations in all my subsequent projects. The general procedure consists of 14 steps, which are: 
1. Setting up environment
2. Problem identification
3. Reading data
4. Data inspection and cleaning
5. Feature engineering
6. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Uni-variate analysis 
7. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Bi-variate analysis
8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Multi-variate analysis
9. Data preprocessing
10. Feature selection
11. Model screening, tuning, and selection
12. Meta-model construction
13. Conclusion
14. Future improvement

## Problem statement 
> [!NOTE]
> This is one of the 2024 playground competitions on Kaggle. The major goal of the project is the develop a model for predicting the age of abalone from different physical measurements via the prediction of the number of Rings. The rings is regarded as a continous variable in this project, and thus the problem is a regression problem.
> The model performanc will be checked by the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error between the actual and predicted "Rings", which is linearly related to the Abalone's age.
