# Abalone regression project

## Introduction 
This project is the first project in my Machine learning project series, in which I boost my skills by completing various small projects focusing on different aspects of machine learning. In this project, I iterated and determine the general structure of a machine learning project, which I will use with adaptations in all my subsequent projects. The general procedure consists of 14 steps, which are: 
1. Setting up environment
2. Problem identification
3. Reading data
4. Data inspection and cleaning
5. Feature engineering
6. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Uni-variate analysis 
7. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Bi-variate analysis
8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Multi-variate analysis
9. Data preprocessing
10. Feature selection
11. Model screening, tuning, and selection
12. Meta-model construction
13. Conclusion
14. Future improvement
